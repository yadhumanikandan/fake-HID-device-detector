# Fake Human Interface Device (HID) Detector

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
The rapid advancement of technology has led to an increase in cyber threats, making cybersecurity a major concern for individuals, businesses, and governments. Among the most dangerous and deceptive threats are **Fake Human Interface Devices (HIDs)**, which exploit system vulnerabilities by disguising themselves as legitimate input devices. These fake HIDs can include **USB Rubber Ducky, OMG Cables, and other rogue USB-based devices**, designed to inject malicious commands into systems without user consent.

Fake HIDs exploit the way operating systems trust USB input devices such as keyboards and mice. Since these devices are considered essential peripherals, security solutions often do not scrutinize their actions as closely as other hardware components. Cybercriminals use these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, and execute malware without the user's knowledge. Once connected, these malicious devices can execute commands at lightning speed, compromising entire networks within seconds.

The **USB Rubber Ducky**, for example, is a widely known attack tool that looks like a regular USB flash drive but acts as a programmable keyboard, allowing attackers to send malicious keystrokes in milliseconds. Similarly, **OMG Cables** resemble normal charging cables but contain embedded chips that enable remote command execution over Wi-Fi. Such attacks can bypass traditional security mechanisms, including firewalls and antivirus software, making them extremely dangerous in corporate environments.

The consequences of fake HID attacks can be severe, ranging from **data breaches and financial loss to complete system compromise and corporate espionage**.

## 2. Understanding Fake HID Attacks

### 2.1 What are Fake Human Interface Devices?
Fake Human Interface Devices (HIDs) are malicious USB devices that impersonate standard input peripherals, such as keyboards and mice, but execute unauthorized and harmful actions when connected to a system. These attacks are highly deceptive because operating systems inherently trust HID devices, allowing them to function without requiring explicit user permissions.

Unlike traditional malware, which depends on software vulnerabilities, fake HIDs exploit the fundamental trust that computers place in USB input devices. This means that an attacker can simply plug a malicious HID device into a target system, and it will be recognized as a legitimate keyboard or mouse. Once connected, these devices can rapidly inject keystrokes, execute scripts, steal credentials, and even download malicious payloads—all without triggering antivirus alerts or security warnings.

Fake HID attacks are widely used by cybercriminals and penetration testers to compromise systems efficiently. These attacks are especially dangerous because they can bypass many traditional security defenses, including antivirus software, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and firewalls. Furthermore, because the attack is hardware-based, even the most secure environments can be compromised if an unauthorized HID device is introduced.

One of the key advantages of fake HID attacks for attackers is speed. While phishing attacks or remote exploits require user interaction or extensive planning, a fake HID device can execute a full attack in seconds. These attacks have been observed in various real-world scenarios, including corporate espionage, red team assessments, and even state-sponsored cyber operations.

### 2.2 How USB Rubber Ducky & OMG Cable Work
#### USB Rubber Ducky
The **USB Rubber Ducky** is one of the most well-known and widely used fake HID devices. Developed by Hak5, it is designed to look like a regular USB flash drive but operates as a **pre-programmed keystroke injection device**. When plugged into a system, it is detected as a keyboard and begins executing a series of pre-defined keystrokes at superhuman speeds, much faster than a human could type.

**How It Works:**
1. The attacker programs a **payload script** using a simple scripting language known as **Ducky Script**.
2. The script is loaded onto a microSD card and inserted into the USB Rubber Ducky.
3. When plugged into a target machine, the device is recognized as a USB keyboard and starts executing the scripted commands instantly.
4. It can open a terminal, execute PowerShell commands, download malware, or exfiltrate sensitive data—all in a matter of seconds.

**Common Attack Scenarios:**
- **Credential Theft:** The Rubber Ducky can be programmed to open a command prompt and extract saved passwords from a system.
- **Malware Deployment:** It can be used to download and execute malicious files from the internet.
- **Backdoor Installation:** Attackers can create a persistent backdoor by modifying system settings through injected keystrokes.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive files can be copied to a remote server or stored locally for later retrieval.

One of the biggest concerns with the USB Rubber Ducky is that it requires **no special permissions** to function. Because it is identified as a keyboard, it bypasses most security restrictions, making it extremely effective in social engineering and physical security penetration testing.

#### OMG Cable
The **OMG Cable** is a deceptive hacking tool that looks and functions like an ordinary USB charging cable but has an embedded **Wi-Fi-enabled attack module** inside it. Unlike the USB Rubber Ducky, which requires direct physical access to a system, the OMG Cable allows attackers to launch attacks remotely via a wireless network.

**How It Works:**
1. The OMG Cable is connected to a system, and it appears to function as a normal charging or data transfer cable.
2. Inside the cable, there is a **hidden microcontroller with Wi-Fi capabilities**, allowing the attacker to remotely access the cable.
3. The attacker connects to the cable’s Wi-Fi network and gains access to an embedded web interface.
4. Using the web interface, the attacker can **send keystrokes, execute scripts, or install malware** on the target system.

**Key Features & Attack Scenarios:**
- **Remote Control:** Unlike traditional HID attacks, which require physical access, the OMG Cable allows attackers to **execute commands remotely** over a Wi-Fi connection.
- **Covert Operations:** The cable looks identical to a normal USB cable, making it extremely difficult to detect.
- **Keylogging & Data Theft:** The OMG Cable can log keystrokes and send them to a remote attacker in real-time.
- **Bypassing Air-Gapped Systems:** Attackers can connect to air-gapped systems via the cable’s internal Wi-Fi network, potentially breaching high-security environments.

The OMG Cable represents a significant evolution in HID-based attacks, as it enables **stealthy, long-range exploits** with little to no physical evidence left behind. This makes it a preferred tool for advanced penetration testing, intelligence gathering, and red team operations.

### 2.3 Dangers & Real-World Impact
Fake HID attacks pose serious security threats to individuals, businesses, and government organizations. These attacks are particularly dangerous due to their **stealthy nature, speed, and ability to bypass traditional security defenses**.

#### 1. Credential Theft
- Fake HIDs can be used to extract **stored passwords, browser credentials, and system login information**.
- Attackers can program keystrokes to execute commands that retrieve password hashes, which can later be cracked.

#### 2. Malware Deployment
- A malicious HID device can automatically **download and execute malware** without requiring any user interaction.
- Attackers can install ransomware, trojans, or spyware within seconds of connecting the device.

#### 3. Data Exfiltration
- Sensitive files, emails, and confidential documents can be silently copied and sent to an attacker's remote server.
- Attackers can automate the process, ensuring that data is stolen within moments of plugging in the fake HID.

#### 4. Network Penetration
- Fake HID devices can be used to **disable security settings, open backdoors, and create hidden user accounts** on a target system.
- Attackers can install persistent access mechanisms, allowing long-term control over compromised machines.

#### 5. Social Engineering & Insider Threats
- Employees can be tricked into connecting a **compromised USB drive or charging cable**, unknowingly allowing an attacker access to the system.
- Malicious insiders can use fake HIDs to bypass security protocols and introduce undetectable backdoors.

#### 6. Physical Security Breaches
- Organizations with strict **cybersecurity policies may still be vulnerable** if an attacker gains brief physical access to a system.
- Fake HID attacks can be executed in public places, shared office spaces, or even during security audits.



## 3. Existing Systems & Their Limitations
### 3.1 Traditional Security Solutions
Cybersecurity solutions have evolved over time to counter a wide range of threats, including malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and unauthorized system intrusions. However, many existing security solutions are **not specifically designed to detect and prevent fake HID attacks**, making them vulnerable to these sophisticated hardware-based exploits. Some of the most commonly used security solutions include:

#### 1. Antivirus Software
Antivirus programs are designed to detect and remove known malware from systems by scanning files, processes, and network activity. While effective against software-based threats, antivirus solutions **do not actively monitor hardware devices** such as USB peripherals. This means that a fake HID device, which operates as a trusted keyboard or mouse, can execute malicious commands without being flagged as a threat.

#### 2. Endpoint Protection Systems (EPS)
Endpoint Protection Systems provide a more advanced layer of security by monitoring system behavior, network traffic, and application activity. Some EPS solutions include **USB control policies**, which allow administrators to restrict USB access. However, these systems often focus on **storage devices like USB flash drives** rather than input devices like keyboards and mice, making them ineffective against fake HID attacks.

#### 3. USB Device Whitelisting
Some security frameworks allow administrators to create **USB device whitelists**, permitting only approved devices to connect to a system. While this approach adds a layer of control, it is often **difficult to manage in dynamic work environments** where employees regularly connect different peripherals. Additionally, attackers can **spoof device identities**, making unauthorized HIDs appear as legitimate devices.

#### 4. Firewalls & Network Security Tools
Firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) are designed to monitor and block unauthorized network activity. However, **fake HID attacks do not rely on network access**; instead, they execute malicious commands directly on the local machine. As a result, traditional network security measures offer little to no protection against these attacks.

#### 5. Physical Security Measures
Organizations sometimes implement **physical security policies**, such as restricting the use of external USB devices. However, enforcing these policies across large enterprises can be **challenging**, especially in environments where employees require frequent access to external peripherals. Additionally, attackers can use **social engineering tactics** to bypass physical security restrictions and introduce fake HID devices into target systems.

### 3.2 Limitations of Existing Systems
Despite advancements in cybersecurity, traditional security solutions have several **key limitations** when it comes to detecting and preventing fake HID attacks:

#### **1. Lack of USB Input Device Monitoring**
- Most security solutions focus on detecting malware at the software level but **do not actively monitor HID devices**.
- Fake HID devices operate as legitimate keyboards or mice, making them difficult to detect without specialized monitoring tools.

#### **2. Inability to Differentiate Between Genuine and Fake HIDs**
- Attackers can **spoof device identities**, making it nearly impossible for traditional security tools to distinguish between legitimate and malicious input devices.
- Standard device authentication mechanisms **do not verify the actual behavior** of a HID device after it is connected.

#### **3. No Real-Time Alerts for HID-Based Attacks**
- Most endpoint security solutions do not provide **real-time alerts** when a new HID device is connected.
- Fake HID attacks can execute malicious scripts within **seconds of being plugged in**, leaving little time for manual intervention.

#### **4. Dependence on User Awareness and Manual Policies**
- Many security policies rely on **manual intervention**, requiring IT administrators to maintain USB whitelists and enforce physical security measures.
- Employees may unknowingly plug in **compromised devices**, leading to potential security breaches.

#### **5. Ineffectiveness Against Social Engineering Attacks**
- Attackers often use **social engineering techniques** to introduce fake HID devices into secure environments.
- Employees may receive **infected USB drives disguised as promotional gifts, IT equipment, or charging cables**.

### **Need for a Dedicated HID Detection System**
Given these limitations, there is a clear need for a **dedicated fake HID detection system** that:
1. **Actively monitors all connected USB devices** and identifies unauthorized HIDs.
2. **Provides real-time alerts** to users and administrators when a fake HID device is detected.
3. **Maintains a centralized database** of known fake HID device signatures.
4. **Integrates with existing security solutions** to enhance enterprise-wide protection.

Our project, **Fake HID Detector**, addresses these challenges by offering a **specialized detection mechanism** that continuously scans connected USB devices, identifies potential threats, and alerts users and administrators in real time. By implementing **real-time monitoring, cloud-based logging, and intelligent threat analysis**, our solution bridges the security gap left by traditional cybersecurity tools.
